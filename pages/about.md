> Meat as we once knew it is no more.

## What is the Project?

The idea is simple. Right now, when most cells get old enough (divide enough times, accumulate enough genetic damage, etc), they die. This is actually a good thing in a lot of cases, but for research purposes, we often want our cells to last as long as possible so we don't have to buy new ones. This is especially true in the case of cultured meat production, where cell death in culture makes it extremely difficult to grow enough of them to produce a reasonable meat product. Anyway, here are some completely unrelated things:
